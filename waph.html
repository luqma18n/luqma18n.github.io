    <h3>Course Description</h3>

    <p>
        In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end
    
        (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and
        explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and
        
        practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.
        
        (Recommended) Prerequisites: Intermediate programming skills in any language.
    </p>
